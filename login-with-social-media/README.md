# Question

Imagine you have a login in your website and you want to support multiple social media integrations. How would you
write it?
In here we are interested in seeing how you'd structure the code. if you would use any design patterns.
There's no need to code the integrations themselves (you can add something like / integration code goes here) and that`s enough.
